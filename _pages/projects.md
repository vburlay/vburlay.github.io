## Computer Vision

- [**Severstal**](https://github.com/vburlay/Severstal): 
*Steel is one of the most important building materials of our time. Steel buildings are resistant to natural and 
artificial wear and which has made this material ubiquitous throughout the world. To improve the efficiency of steel production, this program will help to identify defects.
In this program was used an algorithm by localizing (Segmentation - **U-Net**) and classifying (binary **ResNet50-model**) surface defects on a steel plate.*


## Predictive analytics

- [**Allstate Claim Prediction Challenge**](https://github.com/vburlay/allstate_claim_prediction): 
*Predicting automobile liability insurance claim payments based on vehicle characteristics.*


## API

- [**FastAPI for Severstal**](https://github.com/vburlay/Severstal_API): 
*This WebApp help automate the process of locating and classifying surface defects on steel plate.*
